# pkmneval

This is just something I made in my free time to better learn Vue, and because I started and lost the original instance when I reformatted my HD. Lesson learned: always save.

## How to use.

So I probably won't host this anywhere, because I'm not sure of the legal bits regarding using copyrighted material (Pokemon). Feel free to copy any or all parts of this, as it's really nothing groundbreaking. I would appreciate a credit back to the repo though, as I did spend quite a few hours/days working on it. The image icons are not mine, the type images are not mine either, I just found them on another user's github page (https://github.com/duiker101/pokemon-type-svg-icons). It uses the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.com) to do most of the calls, and also this library (https://github.com/itsjavi/koffing) to parse the showdown team paste. So credit them all for doing most of the actual work. I did modify the `svg` icons to fill with a gradient rather than fill around, but other than that, all credit to Dukier101 for those.

## Future

If I ever get around to doing some analysis based on Smogon usage stats, and D3js to do some neat analysis in the bottom pane, but that's some ways away. So for now it will just be pretty. Thanks for checking it out. Have a nice day.

## Legal mumbo jumbo

I don't own any of the images, and all of them are property of Nintendo. This project was used for educational purposes, and all parts of it are available under fair use and anyone can use any part or whole of it in any way they see fit. All I ask for is a shout out or credit.
